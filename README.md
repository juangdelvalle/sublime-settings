# Sublime Text 2 Settings
This repository contains my Sublime Text 2 user settings.

## Installation
* [Download][1] and install Sublime Text 2 (dev channel)
* [Install Package Control][2]
* Clone this repository into the Sublime User settings directory:

    git clone git@github.com:krohrbaugh/sublime-settings.git ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User

* Restart Sublime

## Environment
I primarily run Sublime on Mac OS X, so most settings are
tailored for that environment.
